### INTRODUCTION:
In these seperate files we coded according to each individual section a,b,c,d,e of the assignment.
We computed the neural data into visual representations according to the spike features listed.

## For part a: 
 we coded a direct plotting visualization for the 2 groups (stuttering vs control). With emphasis on identifying variables such as spike frequency, amplitude and shapelike features. All these are plotted to visualize the differnces between the two groups.


## For part b:

We computed the process of voltage traces, threshold, amplitude, time-to-peak action potential (TTP_AP), delay to first spike, spike width, after-hyperpolarization (AHP), and time-to-peak AHP (TTP_AHP). 
These provide comparative analysis for both groups and help us analyze different dynamics.

 
## For part c

Read and preprocess voltage traces – Detecting action potentials and extracting key spike features listed before.

We also performed T-tests and Mann-Whitney U test for both groups, and we visualized via spike traces; boxplots and violin plots.


## For part d

We computed spike metrics and phase plots(V vs dv/dt) and reveal differences in spike trajectories, with a higher clustered trajectories while stuttering neurons exhibit greater variability. The script also explores acceleration phase plots (V vs d²V/dt²) to assess spike onset dynamics. These analyses provide insights into potential ion channel dysfunctions or network-level alterations underlying stuttering.
